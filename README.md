Problem Statement:-

Taj Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Taj Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of  Taj Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.Here we build a dashboard to make sales analysis easier.
